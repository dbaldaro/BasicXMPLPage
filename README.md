# BasicXMPLPage

This is a simple starting page for XMPie XMPL or OpenXM. 
There is a static version, as well as a personalized version. The personalized version will connect to the 
XMPie Circe campaign that is referenced in the xmpcfg.js file. Only one element will be display which is the Recipient ID, 
as that is only value that we know will exist for each and every recipient in a campaign database.
